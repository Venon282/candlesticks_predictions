**Notes:**
- open, high, low, close = price structure used to build candlesticks.
- tickvol ‚â† vol: one counts activity (number of ticks), the other measures actual volume traded.
- spread can be:
    - Fixed (some brokers),
    - Variable (common in Forex and crypto),
    - Widens during illiquid or volatile conditions.

**Processing**
Date and time are drop. They are not usefull as the time step is regular



















## Tests


In my datas, i have in informations: 

Date and time is not usefull to know as the step is always the same so drop.  
Volume is mainly 0 due to the fact that my datas are forex one. So the volume is not know.
Tick

    
The prediction is made on only one candle because the indicator in this transformer model are predicted.  
A best and futur way, once selected, they will be recalculate inside the model.  

The datas use

The complexity model use:

single test
none | without_volume | without_spread |rsi | macd | bollinger

duo test
rsi_macd | rsi_bollinger | macd_bollinger

triple test
rsi_macd_bollinger
